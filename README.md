## Jake's Jet Homework Project

This is my week 2 homework project.

This JetApp allows the user to view an array of jets in the fleet. The main menu
provides the user with options to view the fastest Jet in Mach, the jet with the
longest range in miles, and add a new Jet to the fleet. When a new jet is added
it is saved to the array, allowing the user to go through again and see if the new
jet is faster than the old jets. The user also has an option to exit the program.
